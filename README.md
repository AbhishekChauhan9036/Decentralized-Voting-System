### ❓ Problem Statement
Traditional voting systems lack transparency and are susceptible to manipulation. This project leverages blockchain to ensure each vote is immutable, secure, and publicly verifiable, without compromising voter privacy.


### 💡 Key Features
- Candidate and voter registration (Admin-controlled)  
- Voter can cast vote only once  
- Real-time vote counts  
- Winner declaration post-deadline  
- Restricted access using smart contract modifiers

---

### 🔐 Smart Contract Highlights (Solidity)
- `Candidate` and `Voter` structs with mappings  
- Functions: `registerVoter()`, `registerCandidate()`, `vote()`, `getResults()`  
- Use of `require()` for validation and access control  

---

### 🖥️ Frontend Features
- MetaMask-based login and transaction signing  
- Voter dashboard and admin control panel  
- Live election result updates  

---

### 🛡️ Security Considerations
- Double voting prevention  
- Access control through smart contract roles  
- Transaction validation and failure handling  

---

### ✅ Output
- Functional DApp deployed on Ethereum testnet  
- Integrated with MetaMask for real-time blockchain interaction  
- Audit trail available via testnet block explorers  

---

### 📘 Learning Outcomes
- Developed expertise in Ethereum, Solidity, and smart contracts  
- Gained experience in DApp development and blockchain integration  
- Learned to solve real-world governance problems using decentralized technology  

---

### 🚀 Future Scope
- Integration with biometric/Aadhaar authentication  
- Off-chain privacy storage using IPFS  
- Mobile app support  
- Multi-election capabilities
